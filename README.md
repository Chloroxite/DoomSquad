# DoomSquad
A cooperative, class based multiplayer coop mod designed for use with Zandronum (though still being moderately compatible with GZDoom).
As it currently stands, the mod is still very much under development, and if you decide to play around with it, it is not possible to actually play any of the content without using give all with sv_cheats 1 enabled. That said, if you do decide to play with it...
### Building
Building DoomSquad is a relatively simple process. Just download the git as a zip file and open the file and extract somewhere. Once you've extracted, open the folder (named DoomSquad-Main), select all the contents, and add to a new zip file titled whatever you want (I know, it's weird). In this state, you can either go ahead and run it how you would run any other Doom mod under GZDoom or Zandronum, or you can rename it to a .pk3 file for the heck of it. I don't know why you'd do that but you do you.
