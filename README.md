# DoomSquad
A cooperative, class based multiplayer coop mod designed for use with Zandronum (though still being moderately compatible with GZDoom).
As it currently stands, the mod is still very much under development, and if you decide to play around with it, it is not possible to actually play any of the content without using give all with sv_cheats 1 enabled. That said, if you do decide to play with it...
### Installation
Installing DoomSquad is a relatively simple process. Just download the master as a zip, and run using GZDoom or Zandronum.
