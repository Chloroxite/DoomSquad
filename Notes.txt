If you are seeing this, that obviously means you are digging around in my mod.
Feel free to do what you want (except reupload it without my permission and without giving credit),
but just know that much like my bedroom, it's going to look messy as fuck in here. I'm new to this.

Oh, and if you use any of the sprites or sounds used here, make sure you credit the appropriate person. See "sources.txt"
